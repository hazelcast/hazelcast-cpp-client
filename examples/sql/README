You need to configure the server to start with jet enabled. You can do this by adding the following line to the
hazelcast config xml file (or similarly with yaml or embedded server configuration):

```
<jet enabled="true" />
```

A sample xml file is shared in this example folder.

In order to run the portable example (`sql_query_with_portable`), you need to
write the java class corresponding to the `Person` class, it's serializer class and put that class or
jar (`<my_factory>.jar`) into the classpath when starting the server and also add a server config for adding the
serializer factory to the server.
