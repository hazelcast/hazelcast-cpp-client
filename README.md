This is the repository of C++ client implementation for [Hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast), the open source in-memory data grid. A comparison of features supported by the C++ Client vs the Java client can be found [here](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#hazelcast-clients-feature-comparison).



# Generating API Documentation

You can generate API Documentation via Doxygen from root with the following command.

```
doxygen docsConfig
```

# Downloading the Project

Clone the project from github:

git clone --recursive git@github.com:hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client.git

We use --recursive flag for our dependency on googletest framework.

# Building the Project

First create a build directory from the root of the project. In the build directory, run the following commands depending on your environment.

For compiling with SSL support: 

- You need to have the openssl (version 1.0.2) installed in your development environment: (i) Add openssl `include` directory to include directories, (ii) Add openssl `library` directory to the link directories list (This is the directory named `tls`. e.g. `cpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/lib/tls`), (iii) Set the openssl libraries to link.
 
- You can provide your openssl installation directory to cmake using the following flags: 
    - DHZ_OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="Path to open installation include directory" 
    - DHZ_OPENSSL_LIB_DIR="Path to openssl lib directory"

- Use -DHZ_COMPILE_WITH_SSL=ON

- Check the top level CMakeLists.txt file to see which libraries we link for openssl in which environment. 
    - For Mac OS and Linux, we link with "ssl" and "crypto" 
    - For Windows, install also the 1.1.x version of the openssl library. An example linkage for 64 bit library and release build: "libeay32MD ssleay32MD libcrypto64MD libSSL64MD".

# Reproducing Released Libraries

Sometimes you may want to reproduce the released library for your own compiler environment. You need to run the release script and it will produce a release folder named "cpp".

Note: 
- The default release scripts require that you have openssl (version 1.0.2) installed in your development environment.

## Mac

Run releaseOSX.sh.

## Linux

Run releaseLinux.sh

## Windows

Run releaseWindows.bat.

# Features




You can use Native C++ Client to connect to Hazelcast cluster members and perform almost all operations that a member can perform. Clients differ from members in that clients do not hold data. The C++ Client is by default a smart client, i.e., it knows where the data is and asks directly for the correct member. You can disable this feature (using the `ClientConfig::setSmart` method) if you do not want the clients to connect to every member.

The features of C++ Clients are listed below:

- Access to distributed data structures (`IMap`, `IQueue`, `MultiMap`, `ITopic`, etc.).
- Access to transactional distributed data structures (`TransactionalMap`, `TransactionalQueue`, etc.).
- Ability to add cluster listeners to a cluster and entry/item listeners to distributed data structures.
- Distributed synchronization mechanisms with `ILock`, `ISemaphore` and `ICountDownLatch`.


# Setting Up the Client

Hazelcast C++ Client is shipped with 32/64 bit, shared and static libraries. You only need to include the boost *shared_ptr.hpp* header in your compilation since the API makes use of the boost `shared_ptr`.


The downloaded release folder consists of:

- Mac_64/
- Windows_32/
- Windows_64/
- Linux_32/
- Linux_64/
- docs/ *(HTML Doxygen documents are here)*


Each of the folders above contains the following:

- examples/
	There are a number of examples in this folder for each feature. Each example produces an executable which you can run in a cluster. You may need to set the server IP addresses for the examples to run.

- hazelcast/
	- lib/ => Contains both shared and static library of hazelcast.
	- lib/tls => Contains the library with TLS (SSL) support enabled.
	- include/ => Contains headers of client.

- external/
	- include/ => Contains headers of dependencies. (boost::shared_ptr)

# Installing the Client

The C++ Client is tested on Linux 32/64-bit, Mac 64-bit and Windows 32/64-bit machines. For each of the headers above, it is assumed that you are in the correct folder for your platform. Folders are Mac_64, Windows_32, Windows_64, Linux_32 or Linux_64.

# Compiling the Client

For compilation, you need to include the `hazelcast/include` and `external/include` folders in your distribution. You also need to link your application to the appropriate static or shared library. 

If you want to use tls feature, use the lib directory similar to: cpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/lib/tls

## Mac Client

For Mac, there is one distribution: 64 bit.

Here is an example script to build with static library:

`g++ main.cpp -Icpp/Mac_64/hazelcast/external/include -Icpp/Mac_64/hazelcast/include cpp/Mac_64/hazelcast/lib/libHazelcastClientStatic_64.a`

Here is an example script to build with shared library:

`g++ main.cpp -Icpp/Mac_64/hazelcast/external/include -Icpp/Mac_64/hazelcast/include -Lcpp/Mac_64/hazelcast/lib -lHazelcastClientShared_64`

## Linux Client

For Linux, there are two distributions: 32 bit and 64 bit.

Here is an example script to build with static library:

`g++ main.cpp -pthread -Icpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/external/include -Icpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/include
      cpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/lib/libHazelcastClientStatic_64.a`

Here is an example script to build with shared library:

`g++ main.cpp -lpthread -Wl,–no-as-needed -lrt -Icpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/external/include -Icpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/include -Lcpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/lib -lHazelcastClientShared_64`

Please add the **__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS** and **__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS** compilation flags for environments for which the compilation fails with error "INT32_MAX" could not be determined. For example:

`g++ main.cpp -pthread -Icpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/external/include -Icpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/include -D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS -D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS cpp/Linux_64/hazelcast/lib/libHazelcastClientStatic_64.a`


## Windows Client

For Windows, there are two distributions; 32 bit and 64 bit. The static library is located in a folder named "static" while the dynamic library(dll) is in the folder named as "shared".

When compiling for Windows environment the user should specify one of the following flags:
    HAZELCAST_USE_STATIC: You want the application to use the static Hazelcast library.
    HAZELCAST_USE_SHARED: You want the application to use the shared Hazelcast library.

# Serialization Support

C++ client supports the following types of object serializations:

- **Built-in primitive types**: Some primitive types have built-in support for serialization. These are `char`, `unsigned char` (`byte`), `bool`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `stl string`and vector of these primitive types. 
- **IdentifiedDataSerializable**: This interface enables a fast serialization by providing a unique factory and class IDs. It requires the server side class as well.
- **Portable Serialization**: This serialization carries the meta data for the object structure. If server side deserialization is not needed, you do not need to prepare the server side implementation.
- **Custom Serialization**: This serialization allows you to use an external custom serialization, e.g., Google's Protocol Buffers. It provides serialization support without modifying your existing libraries where object classes exist. 

## Custom Serialization

If all of your classes that need to be serialized are inherited from the same class, you can use an implementation as shown in the example snippet below:

```
class  MyCustomSerializer : public serialization::Serializer<ExampleBaseClass> {
   public:
      void write(serialization::ObjectDataOutput & out, const ExampleBaseClass& object);
      void read(serialization::ObjectDataInput & in, ExampleBaseClass& object);
      int getHazelcastTypeId() const;
    };
```    

If your classes are not inherited from the same base class, you can use a serializer class with templates as shown in the example snippet below:

```
template<typename T>
class MyCustomSerializer : public serialization::Serializer<T> {
       public:
         void write(serialization::ObjectDataOutput & out, const T& object) {
                            //.....
         }
         void read(serialization::ObjectDataInput & in, T& object) {
                           //.....
         }
         int getHazelcastTypeId() const {
                           //..
         }
    };
```

Along with your serializer, you should provide the function `getHazelcastTypeId()` with the same namespace to which `ExampleBaseClass` belongs as shown below:

```
int getHazelcastTypeId(const MyClass*);
```

This function should return the same ID with its serializer. This ID is used to determine which serializer needs to be used for your classes. 

After you implement your serializer, you can register it using `SerializationConfig` as shown below:

```
clientConfig.getSerializationConfig().
registerSerializer(boost::shared_ptr<hazelcast::client::serialization::StreamSerializer>(new MyCustomSerializer());
```

## Polymorphic Types Serialization
The client library can handle polymorphic objects such that you can use a base class type structure, such as `IMap`, you can put and get derived types. This support exists for `IdentifiedDataSerializable`, `Portable` and custom objects.

You can find the polymorphic usage examples at examples/distributed-map/mixed-map folder.

For `IdentifiedDataSerializable` objects, you need to register a factory implementation of type `serialization::DataSerializableFactory`. See the below example:
```
class PolymorphicDataSerializableFactory : public serialization::DataSerializableFactory {
public:
    virtual std::auto_ptr<serialization::IdentifiedDataSerializable> create(int32_t typeId) {
        switch (typeId) {
            case 10:
                return std::auto_ptr<serialization::IdentifiedDataSerializable>(new BaseDataSerializable);
            case 11:
                return std::auto_ptr<serialization::IdentifiedDataSerializable>(new Derived1DataSerializable);
            case 12:
                return std::auto_ptr<serialization::IdentifiedDataSerializable>(new Derived2DataSerializable);
            default:
                return std::auto_ptr<serialization::IdentifiedDataSerializable>();
        }
    }
    serializationConfig.addDataSerializableFactory(666,
                                                   boost::shared_ptr<serialization::DataSerializableFactory>(
                                                           new PolymorphicDataSerializableFactory()));    
};

    // Register the factory 
    serializationConfig.addDataSerializableFactory(666,
                                                   boost::shared_ptr<serialization::DataSerializableFactory>(
                                                           new PolymorphicDataSerializableFactory()));
```

Similarly for `Portable` types you need to register a factory of type `serialization::PortableFactory`.
```
    serializationConfig.addPortableFactory(666, boost::shared_ptr<serialization::PortableFactory>(
                                                           new PolymorphicPortableFactory));
```

If you want to use custom objects which are polymorphic, you need to register both the derived and base object serializers like this:
```
    serializationConfig.registerSerializer(
            boost::shared_ptr<serialization::StreamSerializer>(new BaseCustomSerializer));

    serializationConfig.registerSerializer(
            boost::shared_ptr<serialization::StreamSerializer>(new Derived1CustomSerializer));
```

# Raw Pointer API

When using C++ client you can have the ownership of raw pointers for the objects you create and return. This allows you to keep the objects in your library/application without any need for copy.

For each container you can use the adapter classes, whose names start with `RawPointer`, to access the raw pointers of the created objects. These adapter classes are found in `hazelcast::client::adaptor` namespace and listed below:

- `RawPointerList`
- `RawPointerQueue`
- `RawPointerTransactionalMultiMap`
- `RawPointerMap`
- `RawPointerSet`
- `RawPointerTransactionalQueue`
- `RawPointerMultiMap`
- `RawPointerTransactionalMap`

These are adapter classes and they do not create new structures. You just provide the legacy containers as parameters and then you can work with these raw capability containers freely. An example usage of `RawPointerMap` is shown below:

```
hazelcast::client::IMap<std::string, std::string> m = hz.getMap<std::string, std::string>("map");
hazelcast::client::adaptor::RawPointerMap<std::string, std::string> map(m);
map.put("1", "Tokyo");
map.put("2", "Paris");
map.put("3", "New York");
std::cout << "Finished loading map" << std::endl;

std::auto_ptr<hazelcast::client::DataArray<std::string> > vals = map.values();
std::auto_ptr<hazelcast::client::EntryArray<std::string, std::string> > entries = map.entrySet();

std::cout << "There are " << vals->size() << " values in the map" << std::endl;
std::cout << "There are " << entries->size() << " entries in the map" << std::endl;

for (size_t i = 0; i < entries->size(); ++i) {
   const std::string * key = entries->getKey(i);
      if ((std::string *) NULL == key) {
			std::cout << "The key at index " << i << " is NULL" << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::auto_ptr<std::string> val = entries->releaseValue(i);
            std::cout << "(Key, Value) for index " << i << " is: (" << *key << ", " <<
                (val.get() == NULL ? "NULL" : *val) << ")" << std::endl;
        }
    }
    std::cout << "Finished" << std::endl;
```

Raw pointer API uses the DataArray and EntryArray interfaces which allow late deserialization of objects. The entry in the returned array is deserialized only when it is accessed. Please see the example code below:

```
// No deserialization here
std::auto_ptr<hazelcast::client::DataArray<std::string> > vals = map.values(); 

// deserializes the item at index 0 assuming that there are at least 1 items in the array
const std::string *value = vals->get(0);

// no deserialization here since it was already de-serialized
value = vals->get(0);

// no deserialization here since it was already de-serialized
value = (*vals)[0];

// releases the value so that you can keep this object pointer in your application at some other place
std::auto_ptr<std::string> releasedValue = vals->release(0);

// deserialization occurs again since the value was released already
value = vals->get(0);
```

Using raw pointer based API may improve performance if you are using the API to return multiple values such as values, keySet, and entrySet. In this case, cost of deserialization is delayed until the item is actually accessed.

# Mixed Object Types Supporting HazelcastClient
Sometimes, you may need to use Hazelcast data structures with objects of different types. For example, you may want to put `int`, `string`, `IdentifiedDataSerializable`, etc. objects into the same Hazelcast `IMap` data structure. You can do this by using the mixed type adopted `HazelcastClient`. You can adopt the client in this way:
```
    ClientConfig config;
    HazelcastClient client(config);
    mixedtype::HazelcastClient &hazelcastClient = client.toMixedType();
``` 
The `mixedtype::HazelcastClient` interface is designed to provide you the data structures which allows you to work with any object types in a mixed manner. For example, the interface allows you to provide the key and value type differently for each map.put call. An example usage is shown below:
```
    mixedtype::IMap map = hazelcastClient.getMap("MyMap");

    map.put<int, int>(3, 5);
    map.put<string, std::string>("string key1", "MyStringValue");
    map.put<int, MyCustomObject>("string key1", myCustomInstance);
    TypedData result = map.get<int>(3);
``` 

As you can see in the above code snippet, we are putting `int`, `string` and MyCustomObject to the same map. Both the key and value can be of different type for each map.put call.

If you want to use mixed type map with near cache, then you should use the MixedNearCacheConfig class and add config to the ClientConfig using the addMixedNearCacheConfig method. See the below example:
```
   boost::shared_ptr<mixedtype::config::MixedNearCacheConfig> nearCacheConfig(new mixedtype::config::MixedNearCacheConfig("MixedMapTestMap"));
   clientConfig.addMixedNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
```
Mixed type support for near cache only exists when the in-memory format is BINARY. The OBJECT in-memory format is not supported for MixedNearCacheConfig;

The mixed type API uses the TypedData class at the user interface.

## TypedData API
The TypedData class is a wrapper class for the serialized binary data. It presents the following user APIs:
```
            /**
             *
             * @return The type of the underlying object for this binary.
             */
            const serialization::pimpl::ObjectType getType() const;

            /**
             * Deserializes the underlying binary data and produces the object of type T.
             *
             * <b>CAUTION</b>: The type that you provide should be compatible with what object type is returned with
             * the getType API, otherwise you will either get an exception of incorrectly try deserialize the binary data.
             *
             * @tparam T The type to be used for deserialization
             * @return The object instance of type T.
             */
            template <typename T>
            std::auto_ptr<T> get() const;
```

TypedData does late deserialization of the data only when the get method is called.

This TypedData allows you to retrieve the data type of the underlying binary to be used when being deserialized. This class represents the type of a Hazelcast serializable object. The fields can take the following values:
1. <b>Primitive types</b>: `factoryId=-1`, `classId=-1`, `typeId` is the type ID for that primitive as listed in
`SerializationConstants`
2. <b>Array of primitives</b>: `factoryId=-1`, `classId=-1`, `typeId` is the type ID for that array as listed in
`SerializationConstants`
3. <b>IdentifiedDataSerializable</b>: `factoryId`, `classId` and `typeId` are non-negative values as registered by
the `DataSerializableFactory`.
4. <b>Portable</b>: `factoryId`, `classId` and `typeId` are non-negative values as registered by the `PortableFactory`.
5. <b>Custom serialized objects</b>: `factoryId=-1`, `classId=-1`, `typeId` is the non-negative type ID as 
registered for the custom object. 

# Query API

C++ client API allows you to query map values, keys and entries using predicates. It also allows you to use Hazelcast Map's `executeOnKey` and `executeOnEntries` methods with predicates. You can run a processor on a subset of entries with these methods. 

You can add entry listeners with predicates using C++ client API. By this way, only the events for the selected subset of entries matching the query criteria are received by your listener.

C++ client API provides a rich set of built-in predicates as supported by the Java client. You can create your own predicates by implementing `Predicate` interfaces both at the C++ client side and server side. Built-in predicates are listed below:

- `AndPredicate`
- `EqualPredicate` 
- `ILikePredicate`
- `LikePredicate`
- `OrPredicate`
- `TruePredicate`
- `BetweenPredicate` 
- `FalsePredicate`
- `InPredicate`
- `NotEqualPredicate`
- `PagingPredicate`
- `RegexPredicate`
- `GreaterLessPredicate`
- `InstanceOfPredicate`
- `NotPredicate`
- `SqlPredicate`

An example query is shown in the following snippet:

```
IMap<int, int> intMap = client.getMap<int, int>("testValuesWithPredicateIntMap");
adaptor::RawPointerMap<int, int> rawMap(intMap);
// ...
// BetweenPredicate
// 5 <= key <= 10
valuesArray = rawMap.values(query::BetweenPredicate<int>(query::QueryConstants::getKeyAttributeName(), 5, 10));
```

This example query returns the values between 5 and 10, inclusive. You can find the examples of each built-in predicate in `distributed-map/query` folder of `examples`.


*NOTE: API that returns pointers may return null pointers for null values. You need to check for null values.*

# Ringbuffer

You can benefit from Hazelcast `Ringbuffer` using the C++ client library. You can start by obtaining the `Ringbuffer` using the `HazelcastClient` as usual, as shown below:

```
boost::shared_ptr<hazelcast::client::Ringbuffer<std::string> > rb = client.getRingbuffer<std::string>("myringbuffer");
```

`Ringbuffer` interface allows you to add a new item to the `Ringbuffer` or read an entry at a sequence number.

You can query the `Ringbuffer` capacity which is configured at the server side.

# Reliable Topic

You can use Reliable Topic if you do not want to miss any messages during failures. Hazelcast Reliable Topic provides a very similar interface to Topic structure but it has several configuration options.

Reliable Topic implementation depends on the `Ringbuffer` data structure. The data is kept in the Hazelcast cluster's `Ringbuffer` structure. These `Ringbuffer` structures' names start with "\_hz\_rb\_".
 
Reliable Topic also supports batch reads from the `Ringbuffer`. You can optimize the internal working of listener using the method `ReliableTopicConfig::setReadBatchSize`.

# Map Near Cache
Map can be configured to work with near cache enabled. Near cache allows local caching of entries fetched from the cluster at the client side. The local cache is updated when the client does a get request for a map entry. The locally cached entries are updated automatically as any change occurs in the map data in the cluster. Special internal event listeners are utilized for this purpose.

If you are doing mostly reads from the map rather than map updates, then enabling near cache allows you to get the entries faster since it will return the locally cached entry which will eliminate any network interaction. But if your application is doing mostly writes (update, remove, etc.) from map, then you may not gain much by enabling the near cache since the updates will cause network traffic. 

You can enable the near cache for a map by adding a near cache configuration for its name. For example:

```
boost::shared_ptr<config::NearCacheConfig<int, std::string> > nearCacheConfig(
            new config::NearCacheConfig<int, std::string>("myMap"));
clientConfig..addNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
```

As for all configuration options, this near cache config should be performed before the client instance is obtained and the client config should not be altered after the client is instantiated.

The NearCacheConfig class has a number of options including the EvictionConfig which determines the eviction strategy used. The options work exactly the same way as the Java client options. More information on the options can be found at http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.7/manual/html-single/index.html#creating-near-cache-for-map and http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.7/manual/html-single/index.html#map-eviction.

Examples are also provided for some options at the near cache folder under examples (also can be see at https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/tree/master/examples).

# TLS Feature

*Note: This is a Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise feature. You need to provide compile flag -DHZ_BUILD_WITH_SSL when compiling since TLS feature depends on openssl library.


You can encrypt all the communication between the client and the cluster using this feature. It requires the openssl development library installed in your development environment. You need to enable the SSL config in client network config. Furthermore, you should specify a correct path to the CA verification file for the trusted server. This path can be relative to the executable working directory. You can set the protocol type. The default protocol is TLSv1.2. The SSL config also lets you set the cipher suite to be used.

Example usage:
```
config.getNetworkConfig().getSSLConfig().setEnabled(true).addVerifyFile(getCAFilePath());

//Cipher suite is set using a string which is defined by OpenSSL standard at this page: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html An example usage:
config.getNetworkConfig().getSSLConfig().setCipherList("HIGH");
```

The detailed config API is below:
```
/**
 * Default protocol is tlsv12 and ssl is disabled by default
 */
SSLConfig();

/**
 * Returns if this configuration is enabled.
 *
 * @return true if enabled, false otherwise
 */
bool isEnabled() const;

/**
 * Enables and disables this configuration.
 *
 * @param enabled true to enable, false to disable
 */
SSLConfig &setEnabled(bool enabled);

/**
 * Sets the ssl protocol to be used for this SSL socket.
 *
 * @param protocol One of the supported protocols
 */
SSLConfig &setProtocol(SSLProtocol protocol);

/**
 * @return The configured SSL protocol
 */
SSLProtocol getProtocol() const;

/**
 * @return The list of all configured certificate verify files for the client.
 */
const std::vector<std::string> &getVerifyFiles() const;

/**
 * This API calls the OpenSSL SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations method underneath while starting the client
 * with this configuration. The validity of the files are checked only when the client starts. Hence,
 * this call will not do any error checking. Error checking is performed only when the certificates are
 * actually loaded during client start.
 *
 * @param filename the name of a file containing certification authority certificates in PEM format.
 */
SSLConfig &addVerifyFile(const std::string &filename);

/**
 * @return Returns the use configured cipher list string.
 */
const std::string &getCipherList() const;

/**
 * @param ciphers The list of ciphers to be used. During client start, if this API was set then the
 * SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list (https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/ssl/SSL_set_cipher_list.html) is
 * called with the provided ciphers string. The values and the format of the ciphers are described here:
 * https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html Some examples values for the string are:
 * "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW", etc.
 *
 * If non of the provided ciphers could be selected the client initialization will fail.
 *
 */
SSLConfig &setCipherList(const std::string &ciphers);
```

You can set the protocol as one of the following values:
```
sslv2, sslv3, tlsv1, sslv23, tlsv11, tlsv12
```
The default value for the protocol if not set is tlsv12. The SSLConfig.setEnabled should be called explicitly to enable the SSL.
The path of the certificate should be correctly provided. 

# AWS Cloud Discovery

Note: You need to provide compile flag -DHZ_BUILD_WITH_SSL when compiling since AWS depends on openssl library.

The C++ client can discover the exiting Hazelcast servers in the Amazon AWS environment. The client queries the Amazon AWS environment using the "describe-instances (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html)" query of AWS. The client finds only the up and running instances and filters them based on the filter config provided at the ClientAwsConfig configuration.
 
An example configuration:
```cpp
clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().getAwsConfig().setEnabled(true).
            setAccessKey(getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")).setSecretKey(getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")).
            setTagKey("aws-test-tag").setTagValue("aws-tag-value-1").setSecurityGroupName("MySecureGroup").setRegion("us-east-1");
```
You need to enable the discovery by calling setEnabled(true). You can set your access key and secret in the config as shown in this example. You can filter the instances by setting which tags they have or by the security group setting. You can set the region for which the instances will be retrieved from, the default is to use us-east-1.
 
The C++ client works the same way as the Java client as described at https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws/blob/master/README.md. 
 
## IAM Role Usage
You can set the IAM role using the setIamRole method. If the access key is configured and no IAM role is set, the client will use the configured access key and secret. Otherwise, the client should be inside the AWS network and it will try to retrieve the access key for the configured IAM role.

If IAM role is set in the config the key and secret is obtained using the query http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<configured-iam-role>. Example usage:
```cpp
    clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().getAwsConfig().setEnabled(true).setTagKey("aws-test-tag").
        setTagValue("aws-tag-value-1").setIamRole("MyInstanceRole").setInsideAws(true);
```
If no IAM role or access key is provided, the client will retrieve the IAM role using the HTTP query http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ and then it will retrieve the key and secret using the HTTP query http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<found-iam-role>.
```cpp
    clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().getAwsConfig().setEnabled(true).setTagKey("aws-test-tag").
        setTagValue("aws-tag-value-1").setInsideAws(true);
```

The details of IAM role usage for applications are described at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html. The IAM role access key retrieval requires that the instance has a valid instance profile association for the IAM role and the IAM role should have the AWS DescribeInstances permission.
 
### Policy for IAM User

If you are using IAM role configuration (`iam-role`) for EC2 discovery, you need to give the following policy to your IAM user at the least:

`"ec2:DescribeInstances"`
```
{
  "Version": "XXXXXXXX",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "XXXXXXXX",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
# PartitionAware

Hazelcast client distributes the data that throughout the cluster. The hash code of the serialized key is calculated and the partition ID is found from the hash code. Based on the partition ID - member mapping table, the request is sent to the corresponding member in the cluster. You may sometimes want certain related keys and values to be on the same member at the cluster, so that you can use/change them using local operations on the member. `PartitionAware` interface allows you to put  data on a specific partition, hence on a certain member. This allows data affinity for the related data items, e.g., customer and orders.

A more detailed explanation of the "Data Affinity" can be found at [Hazelcast Reference Manual](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#data-affinity). 

Please see examples/distributed-map/partitionaware folder for an example usage of `PartitionAware` interface. 
 
# Code Examples

You can try the following C++ client code examples. You need to have a Hazelcast client member running for the code examples to work. 

## Map

```cpp
#include <hazelcast/client/HazelcastAll.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace hazelcast::client;

int main() {
  ClientConfig clientConfig;
  Address address( "localhost", 5701 );
  clientConfig.addAddress( address );

  HazelcastClient hazelcastClient( clientConfig );

  IMap<int,int> myMap = hazelcastClient.getMap<int ,int>( "myIntMap" );
  myMap.put( 1,3 );
  boost::shared_ptr<int> value = myMap.get( 1 );
  if( value.get() != NULL ) {
    //process the item
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Map With Near Cache Enabled

```cpp
#include <hazelcast/client/HazelcastAll.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace hazelcast::client;

int main() {
  ClientConfig clientConfig;
  Address address( "localhost", 5701 );
  clientConfig.addAddress( address );
  
  boost::shared_ptr<config::NearCacheConfig<int, std::string> > nearCacheConfig(
            new config::NearCacheConfig<int, std::string>(mapName, config::OBJECT));
  nearCacheConfig->setInvalidateOnChange(false);
  nearCacheConfig->getEvictionConfig()->setEvictionPolicy(config::NONE)
            .setMaximumSizePolicy(config::EvictionConfig<int, std::string>::ENTRY_COUNT);
  config.addNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);

  HazelcastClient hazelcastClient( clientConfig );

  IMap<int,int> myMap = hazelcastClient.getMap<int ,int>( "myIntMap" );
  myMap.put( 1,3 );
  boost::shared_ptr<int> value = myMap.get( 1 );
  if( value.get() != NULL ) {
    //process the item
  }

  hazelcast::client::monitor::NearCacheStats *stats = map.getLocalMapStats().getNearCacheStats();

  printf("The Near Cache contains %lld entries.\n", stats->getOwnedEntryCount());

  return 0;
}
```

## Queue

```cpp
#include <hazelcast/client/HazelcastAll.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace hazelcast::client;

int main() {
  ClientConfig clientConfig;
  Address address( "localhost", 5701 );
  clientConfig.addAddress( address );

  HazelcastClient hazelcastClient( clientConfig );

  IQueue<std::string> queue = hazelcastClient.getQueue<std::string>( "q" );
  queue.offer( "sample" );
  boost::shared_ptr<std::string> value = queue.poll();
  if( value.get() != NULL ) {
    //process the item
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Entry Listener

```cpp
#include "hazelcast/client/ClientConfig.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/EntryEvent.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/IMap.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/Address.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/HazelcastClient.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace hazelcast::client;

class SampleEntryListener {
  public:

  void entryAdded( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " "
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  };

  void entryRemoved( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " 
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  }

  void entryUpdated( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " 
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  }

  void entryEvicted( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " 
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  }
};


int main( int argc, char **argv ) {
  ClientConfig clientConfig;
  Address address( "localhost", 5701 );
  clientConfig.addAddress( address );

  HazelcastClient hazelcastClient( clientConfig );

  IMap<std::string,std::string> myMap = hazelcastClient
      .getMap<std::string ,std::string>( "myIntMap" );
  SampleEntryListener *  listener = new SampleEntryListener();

  std::string id = myMap.addEntryListener( *listener, true );
  // Prints entryAdded
  myMap.put( "key1", "value1" );
  // Prints updated
  myMap.put( "key1", "value2" );
  // Prints entryRemoved
  myMap.remove( "key1" );
  // Prints entryEvicted after 1 second
  myMap.put( "key2", "value2", 1000 );

  // WARNING: deleting listener before removing it from Hazelcast leads to crashes.
  myMap.removeEntryListener( id );
  
  // listen using predicates
  // only listen the events for entries which has the value that matches the 
  // string "%VALue%1%", i.e. any string containing the text value1 case insensitive
  id = myMap.addEntryListener(*listener, query::ILikePredicate(
        query::QueryConstants::getValueAttributeName(), "%VALue%1%"), true);
  
  // this will generate an event
  myMap.put("key1", "my__value1_new" );
  
  sleep(1);
    
  myMap.removeEntryListener( id );
    
  // Delete listener after removing it from Hazelcast.
  delete listener;
  return 0;
};
```

## Serialization

Assume that you have the following two classes in Java and you want to use them with a C++ client. 

```java
class Foo implements Serializable {
  private int age;
  private String name;
}

class Bar implements Serializable {
  private float x;
  private float y;
} 
```

**First**, let them implement `Portable` or `IdentifiedDataSerializable` as shown below.

```java
class Foo implements Portable {
  private int age;
  private String name;

  public int getFactoryId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 123;
  }

  public int getClassId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 2;     
  }

  public void writePortable( PortableWriter writer ) throws IOException {
    writer.writeUTF( "n", name );
    writer.writeInt( "a", age );
  }

  public void readPortable( PortableReader reader ) throws IOException {
    name = reader.readUTF( "n" );
    age = reader.readInt( "a" );
  }
}

class Bar implements IdentifiedDataSerializable {
  private float x;
  private float y;

  public int getFactoryId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 4;     
  }

  public int getId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 5;    
  }

  public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException {
    out.writeFloat( x );
    out.writeFloat( y );
  }

  public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {
    x = in.readFloat();
    y = in.readFloat();
  }
}
```

**Then**, implement the corresponding classes in C++ with same factory and class ID as shown below.

```cpp
class Foo : public Portable {
  public:
  int getFactoryId() const {
    return 123;
  };

  int getClassId() const {
    return 2;
  };

  void writePortable( serialization::PortableWriter &writer ) const {
    writer.writeUTF( "n", name );
    writer.writeInt( "a", age );
  };

  void readPortable( serialization::PortableReader &reader ) {
    name = reader.readUTF( "n" );
    age = reader.readInt( "a" );
  };

  private:
  int age;
  std::string name;
};

class Bar : public IdentifiedDataSerializable {
  public:
  int getFactoryId() const {
    return 4;
  };

  int getClassId() const {
    return 2;
  };

  void writeData( serialization::ObjectDataOutput& out ) const {
    out.writeFloat(x);
    out.writeFloat(y);
  };

  void readData( serialization::ObjectDataInput& in ) {
    x = in.readFloat();
    y = in.readFloat();
  };
  
  private:
  float x;
  float y;
};
```

Now, you can use the classes `Foo` and `Bar` in distributed structures. For example, you can use as Key or Value of `IMap` or as an Item in `IQueue`.

## Continuous Query

You can register an `EntryListener` for a map that will be triggered only when the specific map entries you choose are affected. This allows you to do more optimal queries.

Let’s start with an example.

```
1.  intMap = client->getMap&lt;int, int>("IntMap");
2.
3.  MyListener listener;
4.
5.  // 5 &lt;=key &lt;= 8
6.  std::string listenerId = intMap.addEntryListener(listener, query::BetweenPredicate&lt;int>(
7.         query::QueryConstants::getKeyAttributeName(), 5, 8), true);
8.
9.  intMap.put(1, 1);
10. intMap.put(8, 17);
11. intMap.put(5, 12, 1000); // evict after 1 second
12. intMap.remove(1);
13.
14. util::sleep(2);
15.
16. intMap.get(5); // trigger eviction
```

In this example, we register an `EntryListener` that only retrieves map events for entries with keys between 5 and 8 (inclusive). If an entry within this key range is added/updated/removed/evicted, you will be notified through the registered listener.

**Line 6:** Creates a built-in `BetweenPredicate` (see [Query API](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#query-api) and [Query Example](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/examples/distributed-map/query/queryExample.cpp) for all built-in predicates) and an `EntryListener` is added for listening to entry events with keys 5 through 8. The method “`query::QueryConstants::getKeyAttributeName()`” is used to tell that the query is being performed on the key of the entry. Similarly, you can use the method “`query::QueryConstants::getValueAttributeName()`” if you want to query on the value of the entry.

**Line 9:** Puts an entry for key = 1. This does not match your listener predicate, hence no event is received for this line.

**Line 10:** Puts an entry for key = 8. This key matches our interested key range, so you receive an event for the entry addition, and the `entryAdded` method of our listener will be called.

**Line 11:** Adds an entry for key = 5 with an expiry timeout of 1,000 milliseconds. This operation triggers an `entryAdded` event for our listener since the key is in our interested range.

**Line 12:** Removal of entry with key = 1 does not trigger any event and thus you will not receive any callback to your listener.

**Line 14:** Sets sleep for enough time that the entry with key = 5 will be evicted.

**Line 16:** Triggers an eviction for entry with key = 5. This line will cause an `entryEvicted` event to be received by your listener.

As shown in the above example, by using an `EntryListener` with predicates you can minimize the events to only ones in which you are interested. This is also known as the “Continuous Query” feature. You will keep receiving all events that match your query (which is the predicate that you provide on registration of your listener) while entries are being modified in the map in real time. The filtering is performed at the server side, so this method is a lot faster than receiving all the events and filtering at the client side.

Please examine all different kinds of built in predicates that we provide in the code examples. You can just grab a predicate or combine them using `AndPredicate` or `OrPredicate`. This provides you the capability to write complex queries. You cannot only query on keys or values, as explained above, but you can also use properties of an object for querying. The object can be the key as well as the value. Please refer to the [Query API section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#query-api) of the Hazelcast Reference Manual for details on queries.

Please be careful with the runtime behavior of your listener implementations to ensure that the listener callback methods return very quickly. If you need to perform long running tasks when an entry is changed, please off-load those operations to another thread.

In addition to this rich set of built-in predicates, you can also write your own custom queries simply by implementing your own predicate (you also have to implement the Java server-side predicate as well to make this work).

## Ringbuffer

```
    boost::shared_ptr<hazelcast::client::Ringbuffer<std::string> > rb = client.getRingbuffer<std::string>("myringbuffer");

    std::cout << "Capacity of the ringbuffer is:" << rb->capacity() << std::endl;

    int64_t sequenceNumber = rb->add("First Item");

    std::cout << "Added the first item at sequence " << sequenceNumber << std::endl;

    rb->add("Second item");

    std::cout << "There are " << rb->size() << " items in the ring buffer " << std::endl;

    std::auto_ptr<std::string> val = rb->readOne(sequenceNumber);

    if ((std::string *)NULL != val.get()) {
        std::cout << "The item at read at sequence " << sequenceNumber << " is " << *val << std::endl;
    }

    std::cout << "Finished" << std::endl;
```

## Reliable Topic

### Publisher

```
void publishWithDefaultConfig() {
    hazelcast::client::ClientConfig config;
    hazelcast::client::HazelcastClient client(config);

    boost::shared_ptr<hazelcast::client::ReliableTopic<std::string> > topic = client.getReliableTopic<std::string>("MyReliableTopic");
    std::string message("My first message");
    topic->publish(&message);
}

void publishWithNonDefaultConfig() {
    hazelcast::client::ClientConfig clientConfig;
    std::string topicName("MyReliableTopic");
    hazelcast::client::config::ReliableTopicConfig reliableTopicConfig(topicName.c_str());
    reliableTopicConfig.setReadBatchSize(5);
    clientConfig.addReliableTopicConfig(reliableTopicConfig);
    hazelcast::client::HazelcastClient client(clientConfig);

    boost::shared_ptr<hazelcast::client::ReliableTopic<std::string> > topic = client.getReliableTopic<std::string>(topicName);

    std::string message("My first message");

    topic->publish(&message);
}
```
### Subscriber

To write a subscriber, you need to implement the interface `hazelcast::client::topic::ReliableMessageListener`.

```
class MyListener : public hazelcast::client::topic::ReliableMessageListener<std::string> {
public:
    MyListener() : startSequence(-1), numberOfMessagesReceived(0), lastReceivedSequence(-1) {
    }

    MyListener(int64_t sequence) : startSequence(sequence), numberOfMessagesReceived(0), lastReceivedSequence(-1) {
    }

    virtual ~MyListener() {
    }

    virtual void onMessage(std::auto_ptr<hazelcast::client::topic::Message<std::string> > message) {
        ++numberOfMessagesReceived;

        const std::string *object = message->getMessageObject();
        if (NULL != object) {
            std::cout << "[GenericListener::onMessage] Received message: " << *message->getMessageObject() <<
            " for topic:" << message->getName();
        } else {
            std::cout << "[GenericListener::onMessage] Received message with NULL object for topic:" <<
            message->getName();
        }
    }

    virtual int64_t retrieveInitialSequence() const {
        return startSequence;
    }

    virtual void storeSequence(int64_t sequence) {
        lastReceivedSequence = sequence;
    }

    virtual bool isLossTolerant() const {
        return false;
    }

    virtual bool isTerminal(const hazelcast::client::exception::IException &failure) const {
        return false;
    }

    int getNumberOfMessagesReceived() {
        int value = numberOfMessagesReceived;
        return value;
    }

private:
    int64_t startSequence;
    hazelcast::util::AtomicInt numberOfMessagesReceived;
    int64_t lastReceivedSequence;
};    
```

Using this listener, you can subscribe for the topic as shown below:

```
void listenWithDefaultConfig() {
    hazelcast::client::ClientConfig config;
    hazelcast::client::HazelcastClient client(config);

    std::string topicName("MyReliableTopic");
    boost::shared_ptr<hazelcast::client::ReliableTopic<std::string> > topic = client.getReliableTopic<std::string>(topicName);

    MyListener listener;
    const std::string &listenerId = topic->addMessageListener(listener);

    std::cout << "Registered the listener with listener id:" << listenerId << std::endl;

    while (listener.getNumberOfMessagesReceived() < 1) {
        hazelcast::util::sleep(1);
    }

    if (topic->removeMessageListener(listenerId)) {
        std::cout << "Successfully removed the listener " << listenerId << " for topic " << topicName << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to remove the listener " << listenerId << " for topic " << topicName << std::endl;
    }
}

void listenWithConfig() {
    hazelcast::client::ClientConfig clientConfig;
    std::string topicName("MyReliableTopic");
    hazelcast::client::config::ReliableTopicConfig reliableTopicConfig(topicName.c_str());
    reliableTopicConfig.setReadBatchSize(5);
    clientConfig.addReliableTopicConfig(reliableTopicConfig);
    hazelcast::client::HazelcastClient client(clientConfig);

    boost::shared_ptr<hazelcast::client::ReliableTopic<std::string> > topic = client.getReliableTopic<std::string>(topicName);

    MyListener listener;
    const std::string &listenerId = topic->addMessageListener(listener);

    std::cout << "Registered the listener with listener id:" << listenerId << std::endl;

    while (listener.getNumberOfMessagesReceived() < 1) {
        hazelcast::util::sleep(1);
    }
    if (topic->removeMessageListener(listenerId)) {
        std::cout << "Successfully removed the listener " << listenerId << " for topic " << topicName << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to remove the listener " << listenerId << " for topic " << topicName << std::endl;
    }
}    
```

## TLS
```
    hazelcast::client::ClientConfig config;
