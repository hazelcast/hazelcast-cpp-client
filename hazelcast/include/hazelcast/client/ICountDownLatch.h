         * ICountDownLatch is a backed-up distributed alternative to the
         * java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch
         *
         * ICountDownLatch is a cluster-wide synchronization aid
         * that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being
         * performed in other threads completes.
         *
         * There are a few differences compared to the ICountDownLatch :
         * <ol>
         *    <li>
         *         the ICountDownLatch count can be re-set using trySetCount(int) after a countdown
         *         has finished but not during an active count. This allows the same latch instance to be reused.
         *    </li>
         *    <li>
         *         there is no await() method to do an unbound wait since this is undesirable in a distributed
         *         application: it can happen that for example a cluster is split or that the master and
         *         replica's all die. So in most cases it is best to configure an explicit timeout so have the ability
         *         to deal with these situations.
         *    </li>
         * </ol>
