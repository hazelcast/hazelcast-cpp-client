# Async Hazelcast C++ Client

Hazelcast is an open-source distributed in-memory data store and computation platform. It provides a wide variety of distributed data structures and concurrency primitives.

hazelcast-cpp-client is the official C++ library API for using the Hazelcast in-memory database platform. It requires C++11 support.  

The library can be installed using package managers [Conan](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#111-conan-users) and [Vcpkg](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#112-vcpkg-users) or directly [from source code](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#113-install-from-source-code-using-cmake) using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
