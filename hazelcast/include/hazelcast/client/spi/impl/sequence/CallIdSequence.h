                     * It is very important that for each {@link #next()} and {@link #forceNext()} ()}
                     * there is a matching {@link #complete()}. If they don't match, the number of concurrent
                     * invocations will grow/shrink without bound over time. This can lead to OOME or deadlock.
                     * <p>
                     * When backpressure is enabled and there are too many concurrent invocations, calls of {@link #next()}
                     * will block using a spin-loop with exponential backoff.
                     * <p/>
                     * Currently a single CallIdSequence is used for all partitions, so there is contention. Also one partition
                     * can cause problems in other partition if a lot of invocations are created for that partition. Then other
                     * partitions can't make as many invocations because a single callIdSequence is being used.
                     * <p/>
                     * In the future we could add a CallIdSequence per partition or using some 'concurrency level'
                     * and do a mod based on the partition-id. The advantage is that you reduce contention and improve isolation,
                     * at the expense of:
                     * <ol>
                     * <li>increased complexity</li>
                     * <li>not always being able to fully utilize the number of invocations.</li>
