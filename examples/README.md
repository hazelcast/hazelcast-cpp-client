# Code Samples

This folder contains an extensive collection of Hazelcast C++ Client code samples, which helps you to learn how to use Hazelcast features. The following lists the samples with their brief descriptions.

**aws** — Configure and use AWS discovery.

**backpressure** — Enable backpressure on client invocations.

**command-line-tool** — Simple tool which can be used to insert simple entries to hazelcast structures and display contents of Hazelcast structures in the cluster.

**distributed-collections** — Usage of basic collections.
  * **blocking-queue**: Shows simple usage of IQueue, blocking queue.

  * **eviction**: Illustrates IMap eviction process and how it works.
  * **index**: Illustrates IMap Sql query on an indexed field.
  * **locking**: Illustrates how races on IMap updates can occur and how to avoid races using optimistic or pessimistic updates which involves IMap lock usages.
  * **map-interceptor**: Illustrates how to add interceptor for the IMap at the server side and how it affects the IMap get.

  * **crdt-pncounter**: Illustrates simple conflict free pozitive negtative counter usage.

**distributed-topic** — Usage of distributed topic.
  * **basic-pub-sub**: Illustrates basic publish/subcribe for distributed topic usage.
  * **reliable-topic**: Illustrates reliable topic publish and message listener.

**event-properties** — Example for configuring event delivery properties, the event thread count and max event queue size.

**invocation-timeouts** — Simple example to demonstrate how to set the client invocation timeout.

**learning-basic** — Basic examples related to the logger, instance management and name id generation.
  * **configure-logging**: Shows how you can set the log level for the client.

  * **connection-strategy**: Illustrates how you can set different network strategies such as async start, async reconnect or non-reconnecting client.
  * **suffle-memberlist**: Shows how to turn the memberslist shuffling on when connecting to the cluster.
  * **socket-interceptor**: Shows an example interceptor which you can use to intercept cluster connection.
  * **tcpip**: Illustrates the configuration for member discovery using a provided tcp/ip address for the cluster member.
