# Async Hazelcast C++ Client

Hazelcast is an open-source distributed in-memory data store and computation platform. It provides a wide variety of 
distributed data structures and concurrency primitives.

hazelcast-cpp-client is the official C++ library API for using the Hazelcast in-memory database platform. It requires 
C++11 support.  

The library can be installed using package managers ([Conan](Reference_Manual.md#111-conan-users)) or directly [from source code](Reference_Manual.md#112-install-from-source-code-using-cmake) using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
