                     * the number of in-flight operations into account when before creating a new call-id.
                     * <p>
                     * It is possible to temporarily create more concurrent invocations than the declared capacity due to:
                     * <ul>
                     *     <li>system operations</li>
                     *     <li>the racy nature of checking if space is available and getting the next sequence. </li>
                     * </ul>
                     * The latter cause is not a problem since the capacity is exceeded temporarily and it isn't sustainable.
                     * So perhaps there are a few threads that at the same time see that the there is space and do a next.
                     * But any following invocation needs to wait till there is is capacity.
